## Reporting a Vulnerability

The latest version will more often than not have any issues or bugs. 
However, if you happen to encounter a bug, feel free to open an issue in the [issues page](https://github.com/BooleanCube/jg3p/issues) and 
the developers will review the issues as soon as possible.

#### Things to check before opening a new issue
1. Have I updated to the latest stable version?
2. Have I checked the documentation for any solutions and am I using the API accordingly to the documentation?
3. Has this issue already been raised before?
